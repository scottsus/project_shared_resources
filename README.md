# EE 477: MOS VLSI Design

Welcome to EE477, probably the most tedious classes I'm taking as a CECS major at USC. I put in a lot of work in designing these low-level circuits, gates, and functional components, so please do check them out 🚀🚀

### Reports

For more visual elements, check out these reports I compiled as part of my lab requirement:
